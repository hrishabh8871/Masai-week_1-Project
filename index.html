                        <b>The Powerpuff Girls is an American superhero animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by
                             Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers. 
                             The girls all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers. </b>

                        Her personality ingredient is "everything nice", her signature color is pink, and she has long orange hair with a red bow She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation as shown in The Powerpuff Girls Movie. She is often seen as the most level-headed, and composed member of the group and also strong and determined. Her unique abilities include "Ice Breath" (develops in "Ice Sore"), microscopic vision, and advanced intelligence; she is also a master strategist and apt planner.

                        Bubbles (voiced by Tara Strong in the series and by Kath Soucie in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the "softest and sweetest" of the three.[16] Her signature color is blue, her personality ingredient is "sugar", and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet but she is also capable of extreme rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can. Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls "Octi", and she also loves animals. She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals, and her unique power is emitting supersonic waves.

                    Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily) is described as a "tough hotheaded tomboy".[16] Her personality ingredient is spice, her signature color is green, and she has black hair in a flip. She loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action.[16] Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without any unique superpowers (aside from being able to curl her tongue as shown in the episode "Nuthin' Special").[17] McCracken originally wanted to name the character "Bud" until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.[5]
